This is a project I did as a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) in the January 2017 session, in consultation with [Fast Forward Labs](http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/). 

Fast Forward Labs is in business of building prototypes by taking cutting edge machine learning and AI research and evaluating its feasibility in the real world. They were interested in building a chat bot that incorporates some pretty cool recent methods for natural language processing.

And so I built a user-friendly and reasonably smart bot for Slack that helps users stay on topic.
